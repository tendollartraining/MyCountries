#My Countries#

This repository contains an early example of using ASP.NET 5 (e.g. vNext) and related technologies
to build a working website. The example allows users to add a list of countries visited and
share those countries with other users. Additional features will be added to make it a more complete example
of a site on the newest Microsrosoft Web development stack.

The purpose of the Fork is take an in-depth look at the new technologies and to provide training to those
who are looking at expanding their knowledge by seeing a step-by-step analysis of the frameworks involved. The new class will be offered on Udemy in the fall of 2015.

* ASP.NET 5
* MVC 6
* AngularJS 1.3
* Bootstrap 3
* Entity Framework 7
* ASP.NET Identity
* Visual Studio 2015 RTM

The expectation is to keep this up to date at least until ASP.NET 5 
is released. Please enjoy.

Current version: ASP.NET 5 Beta 7
